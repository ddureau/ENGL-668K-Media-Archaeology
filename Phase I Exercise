KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
1984

•	What operating system does it run?
Kaypro 2.2

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then: $1800.00
Now: $299.00 on EBAY -- there are multiple options for diskets, but I only found 1 for an actual computer

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
According to the Wikipedia article, "Arthur C. Clarke used a Kaypro II to write and collaboratively edit (via modem from Sri Lanka) his 1982 novel 2010: Odyssey Two." 

So the Kaypro will always have that. At the time of its release, it was mostly praised for its durability. It went through rapid transformations to try to keep up with 

competitors, even if their hardware components remained almost identical to the last. It was bankrupted by the 1990s, but Microsoft did briefly try to revive it and 

failed. 


Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard 

template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

~#turn it on by a switch on the back of the computer
~#I put the disket for WordStar in, typed, but could not get any of the commands to work for me
~#this was the most frustrating of all the computers to work with.

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made?
1983

•	What operating system does it run? 
Apple DOS 3.3

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List).
Then: $1,298.00; $2,841.73-adjusted for inflation
Now: the best model (or model I'd most trust) on ebay is $359.00 but there are some that range lower ($159-$250)

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Apple IIe was praised for its improvements to the Apple II, while remaining capatible with earlier models. According to Wikipedia, this model was available for 

over ten years (from January 1983 to November 1993), which if true, is a testament to its usefulness. Its easy to use functions made it desirable for first-time 

computer owners. 


Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon 

you’ll get a prize. Really!)

~#there is both a switch in front and a switch in back to turn it on
~#I had problems with the monitor jumping, blurring, and cutting out on me. I e-mailed you about it. I tried to do as much as the tutorial as I could manage to 

decipher, but in the end, it just gave me a headache.

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made?
1989

•	What operating system does it run? 
The manuel says "Macintosh Operating System" on page 30

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then: $6,495.00; $11,421.56-adjusted for inflation
Now: There are quite a few on ebay that range from $15-$95.

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
Fun fact: first Macintosh unit to have an internal cooling fan, a feature in computers many of us take for granted. Like most of the other computers, this was 

historical best as a personal computer. From the story elements, this was probably a good computer for primary and secondary schools. While it has decent specs, the 

price tag seems a little steep for what was available in 1989.


Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
~#switch is on the back of the computer
~#I loved how interactive Marble Springs was
~#the navigation wasn't great and so I didn't understand where was the next logical step and while I liked the feature of writing in the margin, I wished I could see 

my comments next to poem
~#it said I did not have enough memory to open *We Descend*
~#I tried to access Storyspace, but I kept getting this awful dinging sound

VECTREX

•	What year was it made?
1982

•	What operating system does it run? 
MineStorm is directly on the computer, but it runs cartridges by way of a Motorola 68A09 @ 1.5 MHz

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List).
Then: $199; $470-adjusted for inflation
Now: there is a model on ebay for $422 and another for $550
 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Vectrex is an entertainment system. It is designed for people's amusement and leisure time. If you have the free time to spend on games and have no need for a 

system with professional options, it is a good fit. Otherwise, the system could not be used for anything else.


Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
~#took me the longest to figure out how to turn this one on, the fact that it is also the volume control/a turn knob made it a little tricky
~#MineStorm was fun, but I found navigating hard, so I just spun the spaceship around and shot randomly
~#I tried *Fortress of Norzoid*, but it wouldn't load
~#I could not figure out *Heads Up Soccer,* though I did manage to save a goal at one point
~#I found the graphics very simplistic, which means they were easy to replicate... the games all looke similar to each other... and mass production general means more 

money because people go out to buy more games, but the Wikipedia article says there was a video game crash the year after this was released and Vectrex was actually a 

failure

AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 
1985

•	What operating system does it run?
Amiga OS

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List).
Then: $1,295.00; $2,624.37-adjusted for inflation
Now: after scouring E-bay, I found a full model for $550.00
 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
It was best known for being a great home desktop, because of its creative software. This computer was by far the most colorful and you can tell in the demos the 

developers put a lot into the design. The weakness in the Amiga was apparently it could not keep up with the improvements of other systems and fell to the wayside.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The 

Future Was Here.
~#switch on the side of the computer
~#I did not understand the function of the demos, other than to show-off their vibrant colors
~#it seemed to be good for music, but I did not play any to be considerate of MITH people
~#it was a pain to keep switching between floppy disks
~#when trying to escape paint, neither esc nor ctrl-alt-del worked~I finally figured out how to right click and hold to exit the screen

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made?
1989

•	What operating system does it run? 
System 7.5

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then: $5,369.00; $9,896.39-adjusted for inflation
Now: there is a model for $379.99 and $549.00

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
This computer was best for business practice. It had a large capacity for internal memory and ease for adding memory rom, which is great for working on big projects. 

At the time of its release, it was the fastest of the Macintoshes available as well. 


Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try 

drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?

~#button is on the back of the computer
~#previous user made a lot of posters and signs on Word Perfect
~#WordPerfect seemed to have more options from Microsoft Word
~#paint isn't as fun because it is in black & white... but I did save my work
~#there is excel on this MAC-files seem condensed, but I can get behind the pizza list
